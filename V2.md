# V2 Planning

Add `accent-hover`, and `accent-active`/`accent-press` colors so we can avoid using transparency for it.

Remove color scales like `paper` and `ink`, and replace with semantic colors, e.g. `page-background`, `button-background`, `button-hover-background`. Only define semantic colors that are actually used within the template. Color scales don't make sense for all projects, e.g. my scoreboard, so projects which still want it (such as TrainQuery, potentially) can define it themselves.

Deploy demo page using GitHub Pages so I don't need to have the project running to demo styles. 

Link to the code samples in `README.md` on the demo page.
